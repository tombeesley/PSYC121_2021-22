## Exploring the data

For this week's online tutorial we have data on the self-administred *Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)* Questionnaire.  There were 6 items (questions) in our version of the GAD:

- Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge?	(q1)
- Not being able to stop or control worrying?	(q2)
- Worrying too much about different things?	(q3)
- Trouble relaxing?	(q4)
- Being so restless that it is hard to sit still?	(q5)
- Becoming easily annoyed or irritable? (q6)

For each item, you had to consider: Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered
by any of the following problems? You had a choice of these 5 responses:

- "Not at all" (0)
- "Several days" (1)
- "More than half the days" (2)
- "Nearly every day" (3)
- "Prefer not to say" (removed)

We have removed "Prefer not to say" responses, and we have scored the other responses numerically according to the numbers in brackets. More anxiety relates to higher values. 

Let's take a look at a sample of the scores:

```{r head_example, exercise=TRUE}

head(data_GAD) # head gives the top 6 rows by default

```

Change `head()` to `summary()` to see the descriptive stats for these columns. Which items recieved the highest and lowest ratings, on average?

If you're feeling confident, try plotting two of the GAD items (e.g., q1 vs q2) against each other using `geom_jitter` (`jitter()` is a good choice here, because we've got lots of overlapping scores). Do the ratings on these items "correlate"? That is, do people with higher ratings on one item tend to have higher ratings on another?

```{r plot_GAD, exercise=TRUE}

data_GAD %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(aes(),
              width = .25) # width is used to control about of "jitter"

```

```{r plot_GAD-solution}

data_GAD %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = GAD_q1, y = GAD_q2),
              width = .25) # width is used to control about of "jitter"


```

## "Mutating" new variables  

While these individual items in teh GAD are interesting, we will also want to know someone's total level of self-assessed anxiety. We can do that by adding up all the items on the scale to give a total. That's very easy to do with the function `mutate()`. As the name suggests, `mutate()` is used to create something new from something old. Here's how we would use `mutate()` to create a total rating on the GAD:

```{r mutate_example, exercise=TRUE}

data_GAD %>% 
  mutate(GAD_total = GAD_q1 + GAD_q2 + GAD_q3 + GAD_q4 + GAD_q5 + GAD_q6)

```

OK! That's a lot of adding up! In fact, it will be no surprise to you that there is another way to do this type of thing in R. Here's another way that has a bit more code, but is much more useful (especially if you have, say, 25 columns to add up!):

```{r mutate_example_2, exercise=TRUE}

data_GAD %>% 
  mutate(GAD_total = rowSums(across(GAD_q1:GAD_q6))) # sum the row, across the columns q1 to q6

```

The main thing to undestand here is that `mutate()` is what we use to **create a new column**.

One problem with the last bit of code is that we didn't actually do anything with the new version of data_GAD. That is, we didn't tell R to update data_GAD. To do that, we need to use the assignment operator: **<-**. 

Consider the following code:

```{r assignment_example, echo=TRUE}

a <- 1 # set value of a to 1

a + 1 # add 1 to a

a # what is the value of a?

```

The value of *a* doesn't change here, because we haven't told R we want to update *a*. It was the same with our mutate function. Let's run it again, but this time update data_GAD:

```{r mutate_example_3, exercise=TRUE}

data_GAD <- # the result of this process will overwrite the object data_GAD
  data_GAD %>% 
  mutate(GAD_total = rowSums(across(GAD_q1:GAD_q6))) # sum the row, across the columns q1 to q6

data_GAD # read out the contents to check it did add the new column

```


## Filtering data 

Quite often in our data analysis we will want to filter our data to select or remove some of the rows we are working with. To do this, we can use the `filter()` command.

To use `filter()`, we simply specify the data first, and then we need to use an *expression* to state how we want the data to be filtered. Let's look at a new data set, *data_maths*, which we can use for this exercise in filtering:

```{r head_maths, exercise = TRUE}

head(data_maths)

```

You can see that we have our GAD ratings, GAD_total, as well as people's highest maths qualification and their own rating of their maths skills. While we might be inclined to draw direct comparisons between GAD scores and self-reported maths ability, it should be noted that ["maths anxiety"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00508/full) is a unique personality trait, that may occur independently of GAD. 

Let's first take a look at the distribution of the GAD_total ratings using a boxplot: 

```{r plot_maths, exercise = TRUE}

data_maths %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = GAD_total))

```

What if we want to only look at this for people who rate their maths skills as *well_below* the average? Are these people ratings themselves as having greater anxiety?

```{r filter_maths, exercise = TRUE}

data_maths %>%
  filter(maths_skills == "well_below") %>% # we've added a filter here
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = GAD_total))

```

### Common expressions

The following table gives some examples of very common expressions used in filtering data:

```{r}
tibble(Operator = c("==", 
                    "<", 
                    ">", 
                    "!=", 
                    "&",
                    "|"),
       Meaning = c("is the same as",
                   "is less than",
                   "is greater than", 
                   "is not equal to",
                   "and",
                   "or"),
       Example = c("filter(data_maths, maths_skills=='average')",
                   "filter(data_maths, GAD_total<10)",
                   "filter(data_maths, GAD_q1>2)",
                   "filter(data_maths, maths_qual != 'GCSE')",
                   "filter(data_maths, maths_qual=='ALevel_A & GAD_total > 15)",
                   "filter(data_maths, GAD_q1>1 | GAD_q2>1)"))
```

It's particularly important to note the difference between "==" and "=" in R. "=" is used as an assignment operator - you've used it several times already inside functions (e.g., `na.rm = TRUE`, `colour = home_location`). You can think of "=" as meaning "set this to". In contrast the double equals operator, "==", asks a question: "is this thing the same as this other thing?" In the above example, `maths_skills == "well_below"`, it looks for all rows in the data where *maths_skills* is equal to the value "well_above". In programming terms, the expression returns a *boolean value*, which reports whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE (and when used in the filter, it finds all rows where it is TRUE). You can see this in the results of the following "conditional expressions":

```{r binary_test, exercise = TRUE}
2 == 3
"blah" == "blah"
"blah" == "BLAH"
"John" == "rock star"
mean(c(3,4,5,6)) == 4.5
TRUE == FALSE # this is getting pretty meta...

```

### Practice filtering

Practice writing your own filter commands in the box below. Try to filter the data to match the following queries:

1. Data for those people whose *GAD_total* is 3 or under.
2. Data for those people who rate their *maths_skills* to be "average" **and** have a *maths_qual* of "ALevel_A".

*Feel free to check your answers with staff in your lab class*

```{r filter_play, exercise = TRUE}
data_maths %>% 
  filter() # edit this code to perform various filters
```
