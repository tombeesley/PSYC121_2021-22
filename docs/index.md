# Intro

This is a collection of tuition material written for Psychology undergraduates at Lancaster University. At the moment the content represents the "lab materials" for the PSYC121 and PSYC122 modules in first year. They feature tuition of programming with R, with material designed to be accessible for students without any programming background.

## Analysis labs and 'pre-lab work'

Where the 121 Analysis lab includes a "pre-lab" section -- such as this one! -- please ensure you have (a) watched the relevant pre-recorded lecture material (b) read through *this section* before your assigned lab class session and (c) completed any specified exercises.

The lecture is designed to deliver important ideas and procedures for learning about analysis. Pre-lab material is then designed to help consolidate this learning, or enhance, expand and apply it in ways that set the scene for the lab session activity. We want to prepare you to be ready to go in the session itself and make the most of your time there.

> Top tip for part 1: Going into sessions prepared will help you get more out of the teaching.\`
>
> Getting an overview or briefing on what you will be doing by reading relevant material etc, means you know what to expect, and where to focus your energy. Don't be shy about coming with questions!

## Computing systems

For all University systems you will need to be a registered user and have received a \`username\` and details about how to generate your \`password\`. If you are struggling to set this up, then contact [ISS ASAP](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/iss/help-and-support/).

All staff and students have e-mail accounts on the University system. Normally an e-mail address takes the form: first [initial.surname\@lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:initial.surname@lancaster.ac.uk){.email}

For example, to contact the Content Director of PSYC121, Tom Beesley, you use [t.beesley\@lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk){.email} (usually you can also use the shortened version, [t.beesley\@lancs.ac.uk](mailto:t.beesley@lancs.ac.uk){.email})

When the department needs to contact you individually we send a message to your **university e-mail account**. In addition, the University e-mail security system, specifically the SPAM prevention procedures, will frequently "junk" e-mail from external accounts from free systems (e.g., hotmail, google, etc.). It's always preferable to use your University email account so staff know it is a genuine student request.

Consequently we stress that you:

-   DO NOT use external accounts when contacting the Department or Staff as messages from these are not guaranteed to be delivered (and are routinely not replied to by Staff)

-   Check your university account [daily]{.ul}, as important University and Departmental messages may be in this mailbox

***Moodle***

Moodle plays a key role in your time at Lancaster. Moodle is the University VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). Moodle is used to:

-   Communicate course information and urgent messages to all students on a course. As a result **it is essential for all students to log in at least once a day**

-   Make course materials, such as lectures, lecture slides/notes, and lab handouts, accessible to students prior to these sessions

-   Provide the web links for each Web-Based Assessment (WBA)

-   Provide forums for online discussions regarding course material (students are encouraged to use these forums to raise questions about course material that they seek clarity on)

## Other Department research systems

***The Department SONA system***

In your full online Part I handbook you can read about the Research Participation Scheme (run through the SONA system). This scheme offers students the opportunity to take part in research studies. The studies cover a range of research topics and are interesting to take part in. They provide an invaluable learning opportunity for students in terms of how to design experiments, how to treat participants in an ethical manner and how to run an experiment. Many research studies in the first term will be carried out by final-year undergraduates collecting data for their research projects. This may well be you in a couple of years time!

Â Psychology students registered on PSYC121 are strongly encouraged to take part in these studies and collect a minimum of 20 credits\* [\* this is an estimate at the time of writing - the target will be communicated when confirmed within the department]. There are multiple incentives.

First, completion of these credits is an essential pre-requisite to use the SONA system to recruit participants to your own study when you enter your third year. (nb you are required to carry out your own research project as part of your Psychology degree). This benefit of this access should NOT be underestimated.

Second, once you have collected 20 credits, you will be able to collect additional credits, and earn further project credits for yourself in the third year. But also, taking part in studies, run by other undergraduates, or postgraduates or Research Assistants or staff, is a fantastic way to learn about research methods and experimental designs and psychology in general. Time and again, many students tell us that they got great ideas for projects and for good experiments from their experiences as participants. Being a research participant provides unique insights into what goes on in experiments and what we can learn from them.

You will receive more information about SONA -- such as how to register to gain access to studies -- in the next couple of weeks.
