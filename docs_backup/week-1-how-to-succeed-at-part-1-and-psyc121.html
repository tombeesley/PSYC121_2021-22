<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Analysis labs and ‘pre-lab work’</h2>
<p>Where the 121 Analysis lab includes a “pre-lab” section – such as this one! – please ensure you have (a) watched the relevant pre-recorded lecture material (b) read through <em>this section</em> before your assigned lab class session and (c) completed any specified exercises.</p>
<p>The lecture is designed to deliver important ideas and procedures for learning about analysis. Pre-lab material is then designed to help consolidate this learning, or enhance, expand and apply it in ways that set the scene for the lab session activity. We want to prepare you to be ready to go in the session itself and make the most of your time there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Top tip for part 1: Going into sessions prepared will help you get more out of the teaching.`</p>
<p>Getting an overview or briefing on what you will be doing by reading relevant material etc, means you know what to expect, and where to focus your energy.Don’t be shy about coming with questions!</p>

<div id="computing-systems-1" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> 1.1 Computing systems</h3>
<p>University systems For all University systems you will need to be a registered user and have received a `username` and details about how to generate your `password`. If you are struggling to set this up, then contact <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/iss/help-and-support/">ISS ASAP</a>:</p>
<p>University e-mail and Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>All staff and students have e-mail accounts on the University system. Normally an e-mail address takes the form: first <a href="mailto:initial.surname@lancaster.ac.uk" class="email">initial.surname@lancaster.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>For example, to contact the Content Director of PSYC121, Tom Beesley, you use <a href="mailto:t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk" class="email">t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk</a> (usually you can also use the shortened version, <a href="mailto:t.beesley@lancs.ac.uk" class="email">t.beesley@lancs.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p>When the department needs to contact you individually we send a message to your university e-mail account. In addition, the University e-mail security system, specifically the SPAM prevention procedures, will frequently “junk” e-mail from external accounts from free systems (e.g., hotmail, google, etc.). It’s always preferable to use your University email account so staff know it is a genuine student request.</p>
<p>Consequently we stress that you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>DO NOT use external accounts when contacting the Department or Staff as messages from these are not guaranteed to be delivered (and are routinely not replied to by Staff)</p></li>
<li><p>Check your university account <u>daily</u>, as important University and Departmental messages may be in this mailbox</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The University has also invested considerably in supporting everyone to work though <a href="https://answers.lancaster.ac.uk/display/ISS/Microsoft+Teams+help+and+training">Microsoft Teams</a>. Teams will be used in teaching in a number of significant ways. Teams will be used for virtual meetings, connecting with other students and staff. Teams can also be used for messaging (‘chat’ functionality) that can go alongside meetings (e.g. writing a comment about some ongoing discussion) and work separately from meetings (asking a question to a specific person, asking a group in a ‘channel’).</p>
<p><strong><em>Moodle</em></strong></p>
<p>Moodle is a conferencing system and plays a key role in your time at Lancaster. Moodle is the University VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). Moodle is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Communicate course information and urgent messages to all students on a course. As a result <strong>it is essential for all students to log in at least once a day</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Make course materials, such as lectures, lecture slides/notes, and lab handouts, accessible to students prior to these sessions</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the web links for each Web-Based Assessment (WBA)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide forums for online discussions regarding course material (students are encouraged to use these forums to raise questions about course material that they seek clarity on)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> 1.2 Other Department research systems</h3>
<p><strong><em>The Department SONA system</em></strong></p>
<p>In your full online Part I handbook you can read about the Research Participation Scheme (run through the SONA system). This scheme offers students the opportunity to take part in research studies. The studies cover a range of research topics and are interesting to take part in. They provide an invaluable learning opportunity for students in terms of how to design experiments, how to treat participants in an ethical manner and how to run an experiment. Many research studies in the first term will be carried out by final-year undergraduates collecting data for their research projects. This may well be you in a couple of years time!</p>
<p> Psychology students registered on PSYC121 are strongly encouraged to take part in these studies and collect a minimum of 20 credits* [* this is an estimate at the time of writing - the target will be communicated when confirmed within the department]. There are multiple incentives.</p>
<p>First, completion of these credits is an essential pre-requisite to use the SONA system to recruit participants to your own study when you enter your third year. (nb you are required to carry out your own research project as part of your Psychology degree). This benefit of this access should NOT be underestimated.</p>
<p>Second, once you have collected 20 credits, you will be able to collect additional credits, and earn further project credits for yourself in the third year. But also, taking part in studies, run by other undergraduates, or postgraduates or Research Assistants or staff, is a fantastic way to learn about research methods and experimental designs and psychology in general. Time and again, many students tell us that they got great ideas for projects and for good experiments from their experiences as participants. Being a research participant provides unique insights into what goes on in experiments and what we can learn from them.</p>
<p>You will receive more information about SONA – such as how to register to gain access to studies – in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> 1.3 Activities for this week</h3>
<p>Make sure you have checked-in to your Analysis session in the Levy lab. All students are required by the University to confirm attendance at taught sessions. <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/student-and-education-services/check-in/">Here’s information about how to do this</a></p>
<div id="task-1-starting-r-studio.-we-have-created-some-notes-to-get-you-started-with-r-studio-1" class="section level4" number="3.1.3.1">

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3.2</span> Task 2 – Practice in completing a WBA</h4>
<p>The Moodle system has links to the WBAs that are an integral part of the course. These are a set of regular exercises that help to consolidate the material presented in Labs and also contribute to your Coursework Assessment (CWA) mark.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deadlines –</em></strong> you will have a regular WBAs. The deadline for each WBA is given within the WBA. Please pay attention to the deadline and schedule your work so that you can complete all questions in time<strong><em>.</em></strong> At the time of writing, we will use a consistent approach on PSYC121 of opening the WBA at 9am on Monday and closing it at 7pm on Sunday. <em>But do check for each WBA in case it is different</em>!</p>
<p><strong>How to Complete a WBA or Class exercise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the <a href="https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=33757">PSYC121 Moodle page</a> there is a set of WBA links associated with each 5-week teaching block.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking on a link provides access to a WBA start point. This looks something like the screen shot below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="files/Week_1/WBA_practice.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">image of Moodle WBA page</p>
</div></li>
<li><p>You then need to click on the “Preview Quiz Now” button. This will provide additional information. For the WBA you will do in class this produces, This is the same information you will see when attempting a class test. For the usual WBAs you have multiple access opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>You then see either a single question of a set of questions (depending on how the staff member has set up the WBA).</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to any instruction associated with the question before answering. Here it is obvious that the number required is a whole number but on many occasions there will be a decimal number and, for example, you will be instructed to answer to 2 decimal places. This requires you to know about how to round up/down decimals. If you are unsure ask the demonstrators now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you wish to finish an attempt you use the Quiz Navigation area at the top left of the quiz page. This looks like,</p>
<p><img src="files/Week_1/navigation.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on Finish attempt causes you to exit the WBA or Class test.</p>
<p>As WBAs and Class tests play an important role in determining your CWA marks we will provide you with an opportunity to experience how these are accessed and how class tests are run by giving you a short practice exercise. This one will <strong>not contribute to your CWA grade.</strong> As a useful learning tool, we may use these results to illustrate certain statistical analyses. Don’t worry, though, we would never refer to a single student when we report these results.</p>
<p>They will simply be presented as a series of numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-3-data-collection-exercise" class="section level4" number="3.1.3.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3.3</span> Task 3 – Data collection exercise</h4>
<p>In order to learn about psychology and data analysis techniques, we need data! Rather than rely too much on artificial data (certainly it is sometimes useful to say “Here are a bunch of numbers and this is what we can do with them” – think about the R Studio example for this week’s lab) for the most part, we prefer to draw on datasets that are a bit more engaging and meaningful that you have a stake in yourself! By using a common data set, that we can return to over the year, we can also build up familiarity and confidence in the data and remove a potential obstacle to thinking about the more important analysis part.</p>
<p>So a key task will be for everyone to have a go at taking our online survey, and contribute to a dataset that can be used throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rLPbl1YI8Y2WXj">The survey is here</a></p>
